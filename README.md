Use 2 spaces indentation for all our files (.html, .php, etc). Please config the editor accordingly.

Git
---

For most of the time, the following commands are enough.

0. `git clone` 

1. `git pull`: get the lastest version of code.

2. `git add . `: after making changes, add all changed or newly added files.

3. `git commit -m "msg"`: commit the changes.

4. `git push`: upload to central repo.
